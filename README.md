  <h1>Synthetic Medical Image Segmentation and Edge Detection Using Image Processing Techniques</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    This project focuses on the <strong>segmentation and edge detection</strong> of <strong>synthetic medical images</strong> using classical image processing techniques. 
    The primary objective is to enhance and isolate regions of interest (e.g., tumors, tissues, or organs) from medical images like MRI, CT, or X-rays, which aids in medical diagnostics and analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system processes synthetic (or simulated) medical image data to identify clear boundaries of anatomical structures. 
    Techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian filtering, thresholding, morphological operations, and edge detection algorithms like 
    <strong>Canny</strong> or <strong>Sobel</strong> are used to highlight and extract the significant features in the image.
  </p>
